This is django-orm-cache[1], changed by byteflow project.

Changes include some bugfixes (current svn r15 from official repository
doesn't work) and behavior change, which is described below.

In official release to enable model caching you just inherit your model from
CachedModel and another work is done automatically, which means that your
custom manager (if it uses 'objects' name) will be overridden by
CacheManager. This behavior is removed (CacheManager will automatically
occupy name 'cache') and you just need to inherit all your custom managers
you want to be cached from CacheManager.
